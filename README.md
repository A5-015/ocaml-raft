ocaml-raft Simulator
==========
https://travis-ci.org/heidi-ann/ocaml-raft.svg?branch=master

This is a complete implementation of base Raft consensus algorithm (not inc. membership changes and log compation)

The simulator runs as either a discrete event simulator or a realtime simulator, in a range of network conditions. 

To build run ```build.sh  ``` and to learn how to excute run ``` ./cmdstart.byte --help ```
