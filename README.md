Implementation of Raft consensus algorithm by Diego Ongaro (@ongardie) and John Ousterhout 

This project is undergo a widescale reflactor on the master branch, and my not compile. I reccomend the simulator branch, which has a discrete event simulator and realtime simulator of a basic subset of raft. To build run build.sh and to execute run ./cmdstart.byte
